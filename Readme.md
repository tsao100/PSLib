# Preface
In 1993, my junior year, I took Professor CHANG San-cheng's, also known by his English name Simon Chang, computer-aided design course during the first semester. The course required students to write programs using Professor Chang's PS library (Picture Shape Library) in Fortran.
I spent a lot of time on the computer doing my homework. The air conditioning in the Civil Engineering Department's drawing workstations was so strong that even after spending a few hours there, I felt terribly cold.
I had only taken Fortran during my freshman year, and I didn't have a strong grasp of it, so I struggled to complete the homework.
I remember a senior from the Physics Department who was also in the course. He was very proficient in C and had successfully compiled his code with the PS library using C.
It's now 2025, the year of the rise of AI. Professor Chang has been very active in politics in recent years, and he's frequently featured in the media, bringing back memories of taking the course and doing the homework. So I did some research and searched for some information, and found that with the help of AI, I could create a copycat PS library under Linux, and then use Fortran to write the homework that I had not completed that year.

# 前言
1993年，那一年我大三。大三第一學期我選修了張善政（他的英文名是Simon Chang）老師的電腦輔助設計的課程，修課的學生做作業需要使用張老師的PS library(Picture Shape library)撰寫程式，使用的程式語言是Fortran。
我花了很多時間上機寫作業，土木系的繪圖工作站的冷氣很強，在那裡待上幾個小時後，都會覺得好冷。
Fortran語言是大一修的，並沒有掌握的很好，所以作業也做得很勉強。
記得有物理系的學長一齊修課，他很精通C語言，也試出用C語言也可以與PS library編譯成功。
現在是2025年，是AI崛起的年，張老師最近幾年在政壇很活躍，媒體常常出現他的新聞，也讓我想起了當年修課寫作業的點點滴滴。
於是我進行了一些研究、搜尋了一些資料，發現透過AI的幫助可以在Linux下創建一個山寨版的PS library，然後再用Fortran語言，寫出當年沒有完成的作業。
